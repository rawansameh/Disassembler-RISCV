Beatrice: I have done quadrant0 compressed instructions in the riscv manual, I have done 18 rv32i instructions with their test cases. I have also developed the abi function to write registers according to ABI. Moreover, I have found out necessary instructions to generate .bin file for rv32i instructions and documented it in a file. I have discovered how to disassemble instructions with non-continuous immediates and shared the method among my group members. I have made all test cases. I made the program read 16-bit encoded instructions followed by 32-bit encoded instructions and then read 16-bit encoded instructions again successfully. I have rewritten all quadrant 0 compressed instructions in the c. format instead of the code it will decompress to. I have also done the bonus part. I have developed another abi function for compressed instructions. Additionally, I upgraded the prefix function for it to be suitable for compressed instructions. I have also uploaded the Source.cpp file and the final.cpp as well as testcases.bin.


Rawan: I have written quadrant1 compressed instructions and 13 rv32i true instructions. I have helped with writing the test cases, debugging and adjusting pieces of code.  I also helped with compressed instructions that needed encoding by hand to write their .bin file. I uploaded Part2.cpp and UpdatedPart2.cpp.


Mohamed: Wrote 17 RV32I instructions, quadrant 2 of the compressed instructions & modified/adapted the code to ease the merging process. I uploaded Part 1.cpp & Part 3.cpp.
