# Disassembler-RISCV

Beatrice: Up till now, I have done quadrant0 compressed instructions in the riscv manual, I have done 18 rv32i instructions with their test cases. I have also developed the abi function to write registers according to ABI. Moreover, I have found out necessary instructions to generate .bin file for rv32i instructions and documented it in a file for my group members to use it. I have discovered how to disassemble instructions with non-continuous immediates and shared the method among my group members, and I have also done the bonus part. I have also uploaded the Source.cpp file.
