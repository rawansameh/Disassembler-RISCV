# Disassembler-RISCV

Beatrice: Up till now, I have done quadrant0 compressed instructions in the riscv manual, I have done 18 rv32i instructions with their test cases. I have also developed the abi function to write registers according to ABI. Moreover, I have found out necessary instructions to generate .bin file for rv32i instructions and documented it in a file. I have discovered how to disassemble instructions with non-continuous immediates and shared the method among my group members. I have done most of the immediates in the project. I have made all test cases. I made the program read 16-bit encoded instructions followed by 32-bit encoded instructions and then read 16-bit encoded instructions again successfully. I have rewritten all quadrant 1 compressed instructions in the c. format instead of the code it will decompress to. I have also done the bonus part. I have also uploaded the Source.cpp file.


Rawan: I have written quadrant1 compressed instructions and 13 rv32i intructions. I have helped with testing, debugging and adjusting pieces of code. I uploaded Part2.cpp and UpdatedPart2.cpp
